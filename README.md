# Project #1: COVID-19 Tracker


Before you start any actual coding, you must meet with your Squad Leader for ~10 minutes to get your app idea approved. Prepare the following materials _before_ your meeting and put them in your README.md:
- **App Title**: COVID-19 Tracker
- **App Description**: My app will provide updated COVID-19 statistics regarding confirmed and recovered cases, poppulation, and deaths of each US state. I will incorporate a drop down box prepoppulated with states. I will also use a second API providing dates and cases to produce graphs displaying trends in cases.
- **API**: https://covid-api.mmediagroup.fr/v1/history?country=UnitedStatesofAmerica&status=deaths : dates and cases trends
  https://covid-api.mmediagroup.fr/v1/cases : poppulation ,confirmed, recovered and deaths of each US State
  
- **API Snippet**:  "Bolivia": {

- **Wireframes**:  [https://wireframe.cc/pro/pp/71da09165404037]
- **MVP**: A list of features you will need to build in order to meet the Minimum Viable Product. This will be the rubric your project will be graded against.
- **Post-MVP**: I hope to also experiment with the longitude and latitude points given to create a map with relative COVID-19 trends.
- **Goals**: What you plan to accomplish for each day of the project week.
- **Priority Matrix**: A graph of your intended areas of development (Pseudocoding, Design, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Testing, etc) plotted on an X/Y axis where X represents time to completion and Y represents priority. Use a professional tool or upload a well drawn image using an image hosting site such as [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) or a similar hosting service.
- **Timeframes**: How long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day. Components should be broken down into a maximum of 3 hours time blocks.
